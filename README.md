# Java Netbeans Simple nice rounded button Calculator with ono ff button and 2ndf
I used NetBeans for the java project to create a calculator with rounded transparent button that contain an off and on button to activate the calculator. 
The Calculator is off at start up and no operation can take place until it is turn on. The Simple Calculator App has a very simple and nice friendly GUI for anyone to use it. 
The Calculator has tool tips to explain to you some of the buttons state and/or what to do when you hover on the key.
